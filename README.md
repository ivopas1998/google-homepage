Today, the 27th of August 2020, I created this Git repository to make a start on the first project that is available on The Odin Project. 

I have to use Chrome Dev tools(or any other Dev tool I like) to create a small Google homepage website that looks like the Google homepage.

Today is the 29th of December and I've completed the challenge to make a webpage that looks exactly like the Google homepage. I've looked up things I didn't know on Google and I have also used the Dev tools and viewed the page source for if I was stuck on something. This project has helped me to get a good understanding of how CSS works, although I'm sure I don't know everything from the the top of my head. I definitely have a better understanding of it now, and I'm off to the next project.
